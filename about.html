      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Amarachi Kalu Ndukwe, a full-stack and React Native engineer based in Nigeria.
        I build scalable backend systems with Node.js/Express/PostgreSQL, native-feeling mobile apps with React Native,
        and clean, accessible frontends. I enjoy solving complex problems efficiently and shipping production-ready code.

      <h2>My Goals in Frontend Wizards</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Master pixel-perfect, responsive layouts with pure HTML & CSS</li>
        <li>Write bulletproof vanilla JavaScript that automated tests love</li>
        <li>Deepen accessibility knowledge of web accessibility (a11y) and semantic markup</li>
        <li>Build muscle memory for clean, maintainable, and performant code</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
      <h2>Areas I Want to Strengthen</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Advanced CSS architecture (BEM, CSS-in-JS alternatives, design tokens)</li>
        <li>Complex state management in vanilla JS before jumping to frameworks</li>
        <li>Performance optimization and Core Web Vitals in real-world apps</li>
      </ul>

    <section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
      <h2>Note to Future Me</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Remember why you started:</strong> You chose the hard path because easy doesn’t grow you.
        Keep shipping. Keep learning. The version of you reading this has already solved problems you currently think are impossible.
        Trust the process. You’ve got this.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
      <h2>Final Thought</h2>
      <p>
        I don’t chase perfection on time — I deliver excellence on time.
        Every line of code is a promise kept to the next developer (often future me).
